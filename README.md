## Acknowledgements

Majority of the work on this project happened within [Code Sandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/button-component-library-with-styled-system-and-styled-components-bunop). I enjoy the ability to switch between my desktop and laptop and I can pick up and exactly where I left.

This project is a recreation of the [devchallenges.io](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/ohgVTyJCbm5OZyTB2gNY#) button component challenge. Huge shoutout to [Thu Nghiem](https://twitter.com/thunghiemdinh) for his efforts to create such a well defined challenge.
